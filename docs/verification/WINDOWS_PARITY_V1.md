# Linux/Windows execution parity matrix v1

Status: implementation and hosted-Windows gate active

This matrix is a release contract, not a portability claim inferred from
cross-compilation. Every row needs exact-package evidence on both platforms.

| Behavior | Linux mechanism | Windows mechanism | Required result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Direct process | argv, no shell | argv, no shell | Same exit classification and byte-exact streams |
| Native shell | Explicitly unsupported | `cmd.exe /D /S /C` script | Fail closed off Windows; durable streams on Windows |
| PowerShell | Explicitly unsupported | Noninteractive `powershell.exe -File` | Fail closed off Windows; durable streams on Windows |
| Workspace | Canonical root; no symlink component | ACL-owned inherited root; no reparse component | Existing/traversal/link target rejected |
| Containment | New process group | Suspended child assigned to kill-on-close Job Object | Timeout/cancel kills descendants |
| Agent crash | Process-group recovery metadata | Kernel closes Job Object and kills descendants | Journal exposes one interrupted attempt |
| Service lifecycle | Deployment-specific | SCM install/start/stop/uninstall | Two clean starts with monotonic journal epoch |
| Machine reboot | Persistent Linux war host | Persistent Windows war host | Journal reconciliation without duplicate execution |
| Stale authority | Fence and restore epoch | Same durable protocol | Stale session/fence rejected |
| Output/result | File and parent-directory fsync, then SHA-256 | File flush and SQLite FULL commit, then SHA-256; no inferred directory-fsync guarantee | Matching content digest now; directory-entry survival in persistent reboot gate |

## Gates

The `Windows agent` CI job is real Windows execution. It compiles the complete
workspace, runs the native Job Object tests, installs the release binary as a
Windows service, proves restart and forced-service-crash cleanup, checks the
SQLite journal, and uninstalls the service.

The persistent-host reboot row is intentionally separate. A hosted CI VM
cannot supply honest across-reboot evidence. `WIN-003` remains open until an
owner-authorized persistent Windows war host runs that row with the exact
signed package. That row must also prove that accepted workspace and spool
directory entries survive abrupt power loss: Win32 `FlushFileBuffers` requires
a `GENERIC_WRITE` file handle and is not a least-privilege POSIX-style
directory-fsync primitive.
