# McLoving execution board

Updated: 2026-07-28

Status values: `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `DONE`, `DEFERRED`.

## Working rules

- Select a coherent batch of three to six logically coupled tickets.
- Use one `codex/` branch and pull request per batch.
- Keep one coherent commit per ticket where practical.
- Address every actionable Copilot review thread before merge.
- Required checks, review threads, exact commit, and clean worktree must be
  verified before protected-main merge.
- After merge, select the next unblocked batch without waiting for ceremony.
- Stop only for an owner-level decision, new authority, or genuine blocker.

## Wave 0 — Architecture and foundation

| Ticket | Status | Depends on | Objective and acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| FOUND-001 | DONE | — | Private monorepo, ADRs 1–15, board, threat model skeleton, CI, clean protected merge |
| ARCH-001 | DONE | FOUND-001 | Finite TLC model; lease type, stale publication rejection, fencing, terminal monotonicity, and completion stability checked in CI |
| FOUND-002 | DONE | FOUND-001 | Digest-pinned Rust/gitleaks, checksummed tools, documented cache policy, one-command HeMan validation |
| SEC-001 | DONE | FOUND-001 | Actors, assets, boundaries, assumptions, 24 owned threats, mitigations, residual risk, and verification map |
| IR-001 | DONE | ARCH-001, SEC-001 | Restricted YAML 1.2 parser; stable errors; duplicate/alias/anchor/tag/directive rejection; byte-exact UTF-8 spans; six resource limits; arbitrary-input and seven-fixture negative gates |
| IR-002 | DONE | IR-001 | Pipeline/process IR v1; source/compiler provenance; structural validator; deterministic binary encoding and SHA-256; golden digest; explicit compatibility; independent byte validator |
| ARCH-002 | DONE | IR-001, IR-002 | Property gates prove deterministic admission, bounded sequence expansion, arbitrary-input panic freedom, and unknown-field fail-closed behavior at every schema level |

## Wave 1 — Smallest truthful end-to-end slice

| Ticket | Status | Depends on | Objective and acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| CTRL-001 | DONE | IR-002 | PostgreSQL migrations and one transaction for build/node/attempt/event/outbox with real-DB race tests |
| CTRL-002 | DONE | CTRL-001 | Fenced single-node scheduler, indexed claims, capability filtering, fairness seed, explainable wait reason |
| SEC-002 | DONE | SEC-001, CTRL-001 | Organization/project identity, tenant-keyed schema, PostgreSQL RLS, centralized deny-by-default authorization |
| AGENT-001 | DONE | ARCH-001, CTRL-001 | Outbound mTLS, enrollment, certificate rotation, session epoch, protocol negotiation, stale-session fencing |
| AGENT-002 | DONE | AGENT-001 | SQLite WAL acceptance-before-ack, journal recovery, log/result spool metadata, reconciliation report |
| AGENT-003 | DONE | AGENT-002 | Linux workspace/process group, durable logs, timeout/cancel tree cleanup, no escaped descendants |
| UX-001 | DONE | CTRL-002 | Rust CLI submit/status/logs/cancel/explain through documented public API and idempotency keys |
| E2E-001 | DONE | IR-002, CTRL-002, AGENT-003, UX-001 | One-stage strict-YAML process through real PostgreSQL, outbox, scheduler, agent, logs, terminal result |
| E2E-002 | DONE | E2E-001 | Controller kill/restart at every durable transition without lost or duplicate logical execution |
| E2E-003 | DONE | E2E-001 | Agent disconnect/restart reconciliation and complete descendant-process cancellation proof |

## Wave 2 — Durability and platform parity

| Ticket | Status | Depends on | Objective |
|---|---|---|---|
| CTRL-003 | DONE | E2E-002 | Durable retry, timeout, post, cleanup, and uncertain-effect reconciliation |
| OPS-001 | DONE | E2E-001 | Staged object storage, immutable artifacts, checksummed log chunks, explicit gaps and quotas |
| OPS-002 | DONE | OPS-001 | Backup, PITR checkpoint contract, restore epoch, object reconciliation, retention and legal-hold drills |
| AGENT-004 | PENDING | AGENT-002, CTRL-002 | Add the production controller-to-agent claim/accept/lease/work-delivery and bounded log/result-completion path so the outbound service executes scheduled work rather than only reconciling |
| AGENT-005 | PENDING | AGENT-004, OPS-001 | Recover `finalizing` attempts from checksummed spool evidence, ingest their logs/results through the controller transaction boundary, and prove response-loss idempotency without duplicate effects |
| AGENT-006 | PENDING | AGENT-003 | Persist a non-reusable Unix process/containment birth identity and return distinct retain, retire-stale, cancel-completed, and reconciliation-required decisions; never signal a recycled PGID |
| WIN-004 | PENDING | AGENT-003 | Remove the suspended-child pre-assignment crash window by creating every workload atomically in its kill-on-close Job Object; prove forced service death at each creation boundary leaves no process |
| WIN-001 | ACTIVE | AGENT-003, AGENT-004, AGENT-005 | Build a native Windows service agent with the existing outbound enrollment/session protocol and SQLite WAL journal; prove hosted Windows install/start/stop/uninstall, monotonic session epochs, process restart, and journal reconciliation |
| WIN-002 | ACTIVE | WIN-001, WIN-004 | Add explicit direct-process, `cmd.exe`, and PowerShell execution modes; isolate each attempt in a race-free Job Object and ACL-owned workspace; prove timeout/cancel/service-crash kills every descendant and preserves durable stdout/stderr/result evidence |
| WIN-003 | ACTIVE | WIN-002, E2E-003 | Maintain one versioned Linux/Windows semantic-parity matrix and run destructive hosted-Windows proof; then close with a signed package on a persistent Windows host through controller/network interruption and machine reboot, requiring matching terminal outcomes, logs, artifacts, cancellation, stale-authority rejection, and zero escaped descendants |

## Wave 3 — Native product surface

Parallel and matrix execution, components, parameters, expressions, credential
grants, protected environments, full REST API, CLI journeys, initial static UI,
test normalization, artifacts, and audit.

## Wave 4 — Jenkins migration

Pinned isolated compiler, exact target profiles, Declarative compilation,
Scripted classification, mapping catalog, shared-library inventory,
differential traces, generated strict YAML, shadow, canary, and cutover.

## Wave 5 — Extensions and operations

SCM, secrets, notifications, provisioners, deployment connectors, compact and
HA packaging, upgrades, rollback, retention, and disaster recovery.

## Wave 6 — Better-and-faster proof

OSS/private corpus, Linux/Windows war hosts, Jenkins comparison, capacity
envelope, multi-day soak, security review, disaster campaign, private alpha
canary, and release-readiness assessment.

## Current next batch

`W2-B` merged through PR #8 at protected-main commit `776d842`. It is a
completed foundation batch, not closure of `WIN-001`, `WIN-002`, or `WIN-003`;
those tickets remain active for the explicit production and persistent-host
gates above.

`W2-C` is active on `codex/wave2-agent-completion`: `AGENT-004`,
`AGENT-005`, `AGENT-006`, and `WIN-004`. Implement production remote
claim/accept/lease/work delivery first, then recover checksummed finalization,
add restart-safe Unix containment identity, and remove the Windows
pre-assignment crash window.

After `W2-C`, the Windows tickets still require the full controller-driven
hosted campaign. `WIN-003` additionally requires a signed package on a
persistent Windows host through controller/network interruption and machine
reboot. Cross-compilation, a test-only service fixture, or hosted CI alone
cannot waive either boundary.
